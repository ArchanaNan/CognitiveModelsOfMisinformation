out a model for the process by which beliefs are updated when consuming news through social media feeds. We use data from our initial behavioral experiment that studied the effect of frequency of corrections on misinformation belief.\n","\n","The idea is that the Agent has a set of beliefs for each category of news. That belief may be closer or more away from the truth. When they read the news, they assess the truthfulness of the claim in a way that aligns with their beliefs. This can be termed as their response. Depending on their response, their beliefs are updated as being closer or away from the truth. For example, a user starts with initial belief of 0.5 in the news category of politics. They are faced with a claim that is not the truth. (`label = 1`) However, they respond that the claim is the truth. (`correct_assessment = 0`) Following this, their beliefs in the `news_category` of poltics will be updated as follows: \n","`self.belief['politics'] = (self.belief['politics'] + correct_assessment*(1 - label))/2`\n","\n","Occasionally, users get feedback on their assessment in our experiment interface. When they do, they will try to reconcile their belief with what they see in their feedback. This depends on how much they trust the fact checking organization (modeled as a binary variable here: 0 for no trust, 1 for trust). If they don't trust the organization, they will not reconsider their beliefs. If they do trust the organization, they will revise their beliefs in that news category. Since belief revisions cannot be an instantaneous process, receiving feedback contrary to their belief when they trust the fact-checking organization, will cause them to revise their belifs a little in that category. \n","\n"," `self.belief['politics'] = (self.belief['politics'] + 1 - label)/2`\n","\n"," ** Consider using Q learning (approach) instead of a direct average **\n","\n"," When they don't trust the fact-checking organization there is no change in their beliefs when they receive feedback.\n","\n"," ### Rewards \n","When there is no trust:\n","What kind of reward would I get if I dont trust the organization and I get positive or negative rewards?\n","(Experiment with 0 rewards, Positive rewards and negative rewards)\n","\n","When there is trust:\n","Positive reward when correct assessment is done\n","Negative reward otherwise\n","\n","## Actions or Assessments\n","\n","Try using actions or assessments"],"metadata":{"id":"ezF6QAW-6SYf"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["all_claims = [\"Majority of lawmakers in 116th Congress are millionaires\",\n","\"Launch Directional Robot Intelligent Circuitry (LDRIC) golfing robot hits a hole-in-one at TPC Scottsdale golf club.\",\n","\"Once you’ve had the novel Coronavirus, you are immune; masks & social distancing do not affect coronavirus transmission; This lockdown was a mistake.\",\n","\"Latest on spread.
